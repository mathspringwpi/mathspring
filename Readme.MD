Welcome to MathSpring.

This repo can be cloned or forked but you will still need to do some setup.

This repo contains the Java source files that make up the server side of mathspring and the Javascript/HTML/CSS
that makes up the client side.

The project is set up to work with Intellij IDEA 2016 Ultimate edition.

The file woServer/META-INF/context.xml is included but contains incorrect user/password to our public database.
If you are using your own database, this file should be modified to contain the correct info for the localhost version
of mysql.

There is a large amount of math content that is not part of this repo.  You can still develop and run the tutor
without it but if you need to see math problems as part of your testing, then you may need this.
It can be downloaded from a shared
google drive and unzipped in your woServer/webResources folder so that you get a result like:
 /woServer/webResources/mscontent/...
 To get access to this content you need to email marshall@cs.umass.edu so that I can share the drive with you.

Many IntelliJ files have been submitted, and this code is easiest to work with in IntelliJ.
