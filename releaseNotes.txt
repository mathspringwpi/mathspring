To Build releases:
   - Use Ant Build:  Sugaree Master Ant Builder
       Run DeployRose_WOJ_WarWithoutContent
       This will build and put a woj.war in <projdir>/out/artifacts/war-rose-beta/woj.war
       Copy this to rose: /mnt/net
       On rose cd to /mnt/net and run ./deploywar to move the woj.war into place for Tomcat
       Use the Tomcat admin manager to undeploy woj
       Select the new woj.war and deploy it.

   Production wars should be built from the production branch (see below for how to check out).
   Should build and push production and then use ant script  DeployRose_PRODUCTION_WarWithoutContent

Notes:
To make sure production is updated with master branch
1.  commit and push master
2.  checkout the local production branch from IDEA lower right
3.  merge the local master branch
4.  run it to make sure it works.  Fix as necessary
5.  commit and push to production

See https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging about tagging commits in Git.  Good
for release numbers.

Git command to ignore files that constantly change locally (e.g. workspace.xml)
git update-index --assume-unchanged .idea\workspace.xml

Goal:  Make sure that production branch represents the code in the ms release and that master branch
represents the woj release.   I think I can then fix bugs in each and merge one branch into the other.

Release Management (begun 11/28/16 - better late than never)
  It would be nice to name and number each release and to know each of the new commits that go into it
 come with GitHub issues numbers.   THis way I could say that release v2.3.4 fixed such and such bugs
 So here is how one must work to achieve this:

    - Require that before I do anything (bug fix or feature), it be entered into GitHub as an issue with a number.
    -  I'd then have to do a commit that contains code for only a single issue.
    -  The commit comment should BEGIN with the ISSUE NUMBER!
    -  When closing out the issue I would know the next release # (based on the last one) so it should be mentioned
    - Release numbers should go like v2.1.X when bugs are fixed and 2.X.0 when new features go in (and maybe bug fixes too).
    -  Tag the final commit before releasing (VCS | Git | Tag... and then commit/push tag button selected)
         OR git tag -a v2.1.4 -m 'message' )
    -  If I want to know what issues have been taken care of in a release I can look at the
       commits since a given tag. (git log v2.1.4..HEAD --oneline)

    https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging
    Commands to tag a release:
    After the last commit:  use git tag -a v2.1 -m "comment here" OR tag a specific commit by using
    git log --pretty=oneline to see all commits and then git tag -a v1.2 9fceb02 with first 7 digits of commit #.
    git show v2.1 will give info about the tagged commit.


  After the last commit:  use
     git tag -a v2.1 -m "comment here" OR tag a specific commit by using
       git tag -a v2.1

    git tag will show all the tags

   How to find all the commits after a particular tag (v2.1)

    git log v2.1..HEAD  or git log v2.1..HEAD --oneline


   To show all commits with tags since a given tag and put in file:
     git log v2.1.5..HEAD --oneline --decorate > u:/mathspring/fixes.txt

git log v2.1.13..HEAD --oneline
git tag -a v2.1.14 -m "comment here"

includes Rafaels additions to the topic editor in the teacher tools.   Built some new ant scripts (auto-gened)  and then wrote buildSugaree.xml
which is a master script that imports the auto-gened ones.   The auto-gened ant scripts need to be done more frequently (i.e. when new Maven
dependencies are added ) because the Maven libs are part of the ant scripts.
Released both WOJ and MS systems and pushed to master and production
